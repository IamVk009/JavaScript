DOM - Document Object Model
> Whatever we write on a webpage using html, Angular, React, these all are made from objects like 
  <head>, <body>, <component>
> DOM simply means, the document which we have created is made from which objects, what is its structure
  and how the page looks like with these objects.
> If we know the objects using which our document is formed, then we can manipulate that document, 
  like we can add new objects to it.

> Try following commands in Console of the browser bg-black

    - console.log(window)
    - console.log(window.document)
    - console.log(document)
    - console.dir(document)
    - console.log(document.location)
    - console.log(document.links)
    - console.log(document.links[3])
    - document.getElementById('id of any object')
    - document.getElementById('id of any object') = 'New Value'
